"The Narrator describes the scene from the deck of a ship named Nellie as it rests at anchor at the mouth of the River Thames, near London. The five men on board the ship—the Director of Companies, the Lawyer, the Accountant, the Narrator, and Marlow, old friends from their seafaring days—settle down to await the changing of the tide. They stare down the mouth of the river into the Atlantic Ocean, a view that stretches like ""the beginning of an interminable waterway.""","The opening establishes a dark tone. Water is often a symbol of the unconscious, so the ""interminable waterway"" connecting civilized England to the rest of the world implies that England's civilization is just a veneer over the dark heart all men share. That the characters in the ship are known by their jobs and not their names hints at the hollowness of civilization: their selves have been swallowed by their roles."
"In silence they watch the sunset, and the Narrator remembers the fabled ships and men of English history who set sail from the Thames on voyages of trade or conquest, carrying with them ""The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empire.""",The Narrator's thoughts about conquest and colonialism are conventional and romantic: that great men go out with great dreams and build great empires to the greater glory of the world.
"Suddenly Marlow interrupts the silence. ""And this also,"" Marlow says, ""has been one of the dark places of the earth."" He imagines England as it must have appeared to the first Romans sent to conquer it: a savage, mysterious place that both appalled and attracted them, that made them feel powerless and filled them with hate.","But Marlow takes an opposite view: he sees England itself as once one of the savage places, and imagines how that savagery warped its conquerors. The implication is that hidden behind its civilization England has a ""dark"" heart."
"Marlow observes that none of the men on the boat would feel just like those Romans, because the men on the boat have a ""devotion to efficiency,"" while the Romans wanted simply to conquer.","Marlow believes that a devotion to efficiency, a devotion to work, protects a man from being corrupted by powerlessness and hate."
"Yet Marlow adds that conquest is never pretty and usually involves the powerful taking land from those who look different and are less powerful. Conquest, Marlow says, is redeemed only by the ideas behind them, ideas that are so beautiful men bow down before them.","The practice of conquest and colonialism is always ruthless. But the noble idea motivating conquest, such as civilizing the savages, can be so beautiful it hides the ruthlessness even from the conquerors."
"Marlow then reminds the other men that he once served as captain of a freshwater riverboat, and begins to tell his story. As a young boy, he had a passion for maps and unknown places. As he grew older many of those places become known, and many he visited himself. Yet Africa still fascinated him, especially its mighty river, the Congo. After years of ocean voyages in which he had ""always went by [his] own road and on [his] own legs,"" Marlow asks his aunt to use her influence help him get a job as a steamship operator for the Company, a continental European trading concern in Africa.","Marlow makes it clear he doesn't usually ask people for favors, instead going by ""his own road and on his own legs"" because of his belief in the honesty and importance of work. He is not comfortable relying on others to do his work for him, and sees it as a possibly dangerous and definitely shameful thing to do."
"The Company hires him immediately: it has an open position because one of its captains, a Dane named Fresleven, had recently been killed. After some time in the jungle, the normally mild-mannered Fresleven had started hitting the native chief of a village with a cane over a disagreement regarding two black hens, and was accidentally killed by the chief's son. The natives, in fear, immediately abandoned their village.","The absurd story of Fresleven's death foreshadows Marlow's absurd experience in the jungle, where colonialist white men go insane and clash with the exploited natives, producing violence and more absurdity."
"Marlow travels to the unnamed European city where the Company has its headquarters. He describes the city as a ""whited sepulcher.""","A sepulcher is a tomb, and hides in its heart either emptiness or death."
"At the Company's office, Marlow is let into a reception area presided over by two women, one fat, one slim, both of whom constantly knit black wool. There, Marlow examines a map of Africa filled in by various colors representing the European countries that colonized those areas. He briefly meets the head of the Company (a ""pale plumpness in a frock coat""), then is directed to a doctor. While measuring Marlow's head, the doctor comments that in Africa ""the changes happen inside"" and asks Marlow if his family has a history of insanity.","More foreshadowing of what Marlow will soon experience in colonial Africa. The women in black seem to symbolize fate or death, the head of the Company's ""plumpness"" covered by a ""frock coat"" implies greed masked by civility, and the doctor explicitly says that Africa drives Europeans crazy."
"Marlow has a farewell chat with his aunt, who sees her nephew as an ""emissary of light"" off to educate the African natives out of their ""horrid ways."" Marlow points out to his aunt that the company is run for profit, not missionary work, and expresses amazement to his friends on the boat how out of touch women are with the truth.","Earlier Marlow said that the beautiful idea behind colonization masks the ruthless practice of colonialism. Well, his aunt clearly buys the idea, and in doing so establishes women as symbols of civilization's inability to see its hollow corruption."
"Marlow boards the steamer that will take him to the mouth of the Congo with a sense of foreboding. To Marlow on the steamer, the forested coast of Africa looks like an impenetrable enigma, inviting and scorning him at the same time. He occasionally sees canoes paddled by native Africans, and once sees a French ship firing its guns into the dense forest at invisible ""enemies.""","Marlow goes to Africa because as a boy he had a passion for unknown places. He wanted to know the unknown. But Africa resists being known, and makes colonialists do ridiculous, hollow things like shoot at forests."
"At the mouth of the Congo, Marlow gets passage for thirty miles from a small steamer piloted by a Swede. The Swede mocks the ""government chaps"" at the shore as men who will do anything for money, and wonders what happens to such men when they get further into the continent.","The pilot, a man who works, condemns the colonialists who care not about work, but about money. The pilot's question about what happens to such people in the jungle is more foreshadowing."
"At last they reach the Company's Outer Station, a chaotic and disorganized place. Machinery rusts everywhere, black laborers blast away at a cliff face for no reason. Marlow comments to the men on the Nellie that he had long known the ""lusty devils"" of violence and greed that drive men, but in Africa encountered ""a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly.""","Note Marlow's horror at the inefficiency of the station and the rusting of machinery. The ""lusty devils"" are the desires that move men to act badly, but without deception. The ""pretending"" devils move men to fake their noble intentions for greedy ends."
"Marlow then stumbles upon what he calls the Grove of Death, a grove among the trees that is filled with weak and dying native laborers, who are living out their last moments in the shade of the ancient trees.","Marlow sees the death of the natives with the same horror as the rusting machinery. It's a tragedy to him, but not a human tragedy."
"At the station, the Chief Accountant impresses Marlow with his good grooming. One day the Chief Accountant mentions that further up the river Marlow will probably meet Mr. Kurtz, a station head who sends in as much ivory as all the others put together and who ""will be a somebody in the [Company] Administration before long."" He asks Marlow to tell Kurtz that all is satisfactory, saying he doesn't want to send a letter for fear that rivals at the Central Station will intercept it.","The Chief Accountants comments both introduce Kurtz as a remarkably talented fellow and also convey the backbiting and politics going on under the surface in the Company. Marlow admires the Chief Accountant's grooming because such hygienic habits involve disciplined work, especially in the midst of the chaos of Outer Station."
"Just then a dying ""agent' from up country"" is brought into the Chief Accountants quarters for lack of other space, which gently annoys the accountant. When, a while later, there is a ""tumult"" of noise as a caravan of pilgrims and natives comes into the station, the Chief Accountant comments, ""When one has got to make correct entries, one comes to hate these savages—hate them to death.""","Yet beneath the Chief Accountant's civilized exterior, he's filled with the sense of ""powerlessness and hate"" that Marlow earlier described infecting the Roman conquerors of England."
"A few days later Marlow joins a caravan headed the two hundred miles upriver to Central Station. After a fifteen-day trek through the jungle during which the only other white man fell ill and many of the native porters deserted rather than carry the sick man, Marlow reaches the Station.",The absurd inefficiency and waste of the colonial effort just keeps growing...
"At the station, Marlow is greeted by the first man he sees with news that the ship he was supposed to pilot has sunk. Apparently, the General Manager had suddenly decided to try to reach Kurtz at the Inner Station with an inexperienced pilot at the helm of the steamship. The steamship promptly sank.","...and growing... until it's clear that the colonial effort isn't about building anything, and isn't motivated by a central civilized idea. It's motivated by greed, which is bound to produce inefficiency and waste."
"Marlow, on the Nellie, says that though he can't be sure, he suspects that it's possible the General Manager wanted the steamship to sink.",Marlow's guess foreshadows the General Manager's negative feelings about Kurtz.
"Marlow is immediately taken to see this General Manager, who is thoroughly unremarkable in intelligence, leadership, and unskilled at even maintaining order. Marlow believes the General Manager holds his position through two traits: he inspires vague uneasiness in others, and unlike any other Europeans he's resistant to all the tropical diseases.","The General Manager is the embodiment of the ""pretending"" devils Marlow mentioned earlier. His main trait is that he doesn't die! He's defined by his lack of identity. In other words, he's hollow."
"The General Manager explains why he took the steamship onto the river before Marlow, its pilot, arrived: Kurtz, the Company's best agent, is sick. The General Manager takes special interest when Marlow mentions he heard Kurtz's name mentioned on the coast. The General Manager estimates that it will take three months to repair the ship, and turns out to be almost exactly right.",The General Manager's interest that Marlow had earlier heard of Kurtz implies the Manager's concern at Kurtz influence and power in the Company. The Manager's perfect guess about the time needed to fix the ship implies he did purposely sink it.
"Marlow sets to work fixing the ship and watches the absurd happenings of Central Station, where the various company agents (employees) do no work, stroll about aimlessly, and dream of ivory and wealth. Marlow describes the place as ""unreal.""","Men who do no work strike Marlow as ""unreal"" and without substance. Work provides a reality one can cling to."
"One night a shed bursts into flame. As Marlow approaches he sees a laborer being beaten for setting the blaze and overhears the General Manager talking with another man about Kurtz, saying they should try to ""take advantage of this unfortunate accident."" The General Manager departs, and Marlow ends up in a conversation with the other man, a young ""agent"" whose responsibility it is to make bricks (which he never does) and whom the other agents think is the General Manager's spy.","The General Manager's concern for Kurtz is obviously faked. He has to try to save the sick Kurtz because it would look bad if he didn't, but as long as he has an excuse (the sunken steamship) to avoid helping Kurtz, he'll take it. The Brickmaker has a job he never does: the essence of hollowness, hypocrisy, and inefficiency."
"Marlow follows the Brickmaker back to his quarters, which are much nicer than any but the General Manager's. As they talk, Marlow realizes the Brickmaker is trying to get information from him because Marlow's Aunt's contacts in the Company are the same people who sent Kurtz to Africa. The Brickmaker bitterly says that Marlow and Kurtz are both ""of the new gang—the gang of virtue"" meant to bring proper morals and European enlightenment to the colonial activities in Africa.","The revelation that Kurtz is backed by the same people who are close to Marlow's Aunt indicate that Kurtz isn't like the other agents. Rather than hide his greed behind false civility, Kurtz seems actually to be a man profoundly dedicated to ethics and morality. Marlow begins to see Kurtz as an antidote to the evils and hollowness of civilization."
"The Brickmaker, whom Marlow now calls a ""papier-mâché Mephistopheles,"" continues to speak about Kurtz, and asks Marlow not to give Kurtz a wrong impression of him. Marlow realizes that both the General Manager and the Brickmaker see Kurtz as a threat to their dreams of advancement.","Mephistopheles is a devil. Papier-mâché is a craft that produces hollow structures. A ""papier-mâché Mephistopheles"" is therefore a hollow devil, and a heck of an insult."
"Though he hates lies because they have a ""taint of death"" and telling them is like ""biting something rotten,"" Marlow pretends to have as much influence in Europe as the Brickmaker thinks he has in order to get the Brickmaker to speed up the arrival of the rivets needed to fix the steamship. Marlow has an idea that the faster the steamship is fixed the better it will be for Kurtz.","By doing the thing he hates most in the world—lying—in order to faster fix the steamboat and get to Kurtz, Marlow shows a sudden sense of allegiance to the moral Kurtz. Marlow's lie also foreshadows a lie he will tell later to Kurtz's Intended."
"Suddenly, Marlow breaks off telling his story in order to try to explain to the men sitting on the ship in the Thames how hard it is to get across his experiences, though he is comforted by the fact that his fellows on the ship, men who see and know him, can at least ""see more than I could then."" The Narrator observes that it was now so dark they couldn't see Marlow at all.","Marlow despairs about the inability for one man to explain himself to another. The novel emphasizes this point ironically: when Marlow takes comfort that at least the men on the Nellie know and see him, the fact is that the men actually can't see him at all.."
"Marlow resumes his story. When the Brickmaker leaves, Marlow boards his broken steamship, which he has come to love after putting in so much hard work to rebuild it. Marlow says of work: ""I don't like work... but I like what is in the work—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality."" Marlow tells his foreman they'll soon have rivets. The two of them do a little dance of joy.","Here Marlow explicitly describes why he values work. Note that the ""reality"" and ""chance to find yourself"" that work provides directly address Marlow's discomfort with the lack of truth in the world and his growing sense of the hollowness of civilization."
"But weeks pass and the rivets don't come. Instead, a group of ""pilgrims"" calling itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition arrives, led by the General Manager's uncle. They are all greedy, cowardly, and without any sort of foresight or understanding of work.","It's no coincidence the Eldorado Expedition is named after a mythical city made of gold. In Marlow's eyes, the pilgrims themselves are unreal, just hollow vessels for their greed."
"Without rivets, Marlow can't do any work either. He has lots of time to think, and begins to wonder about Kurtz's morals, and about how Kurtz would act if he did become general manager.","What he's heard of Kurtz makes Marlow ponder if perhaps civilization isn't hollow, if perhaps there is some truth, if maybe colonialism can match the beautiful idea behind it."
"Some time later, as Marlow rests on his steamship, he overhears the General Manager talking with his Uncle about Kurtz. They are annoyed that Kurtz has so much influence in the Company and sends back so much ivory. The General Manager also mentions a trader who lives near Kurtz and is apparently stealing Company profits. The uncle advises the General Manager to take advantage of the fact that there's no authority around and just hang the trader.","The Uncle's advice that the General Manager just hang the trader since there are no authorities around is the ultimate sign that civilization is hollow. The Uncle is saying that acting in a civilized way isn't a deeply held conviction or inherent human characteristic, but rather just an act designed to avoid punishment."
"They next discuss the rumors that Kurtz is sick. Kurtz was supposed to return to the Central Station along with his latest batch of ivory, but apparently came halfway down the river and then turned back. The General Manager angrily mentions Kurtz's conviction that the stations should be focused as much on humanizing and civilizing the savages as on trade. The General Manager's uncle replies that the General Manager should trust the jungle, implying that tropical disease will eventually kill Kurtz.","The General Manager here exposes his own disregard, and Kurtz's support, for any of the moral reasons for colonization, such as civilizing the natives given by Europeans. (Of course, the condescending idea that the natives needed to be civilized by Europeans at all would be considered racist today)."
"A few days later the General Manager's uncle and his Eldorado Expedition head into the jungle. Marlow later heard that all their donkeys died, but never heard what happened to the ""less valuable animals""—the men.","Marlow isn't just bitter: he really thinks the donkeys are more valuable. Donkeys work and aren't hollow, as opposed to the Eldorado men."
"After three months of work, Marlow finishes repairing the ship. He immediately sets off upriver with the General Manager, a few pilgrims, and thirty cannibals as crew. Marlow prefers the cannibals, who don't actually eat each other and of whom he says, ""They were men I could work with.""","Marlow prefers the cannibals for the same reason he prefers the donkeys: they're primitive and simple, so they aren't hollow. (Though the depiction of the cannibals as simple is racist and condescending.)"
"The trip is long and difficult. Marlow describes the jungle as a ""thing monstrous and free"" and the natives as beings ""who howled and leapt and made horrid faces."" Yet Marlow feels some connection to the ""terrible frankness"" of the natives, knowing that he has some of that primitiveness in his own heart. He is thankful that his work keeping the ship afloat occupies his attention most of the time, and hides the ""inner truth.""","By commenting on his own sense of kinship with the ""primitive"" natives, Marlow is implying that all men have aspects of the primitive within them. He believes that work provides escape from this ""inner truth."""
"Still, Marlow tells the other men on the Nellie, he often has a sense of the ""mysterious stillness"" watching him at his ""monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight-ropes for—what is it? half a crown a tumble?"" One of the men on the Nellie warns Marlow to ""try to be civil."" Marlow responds, ""I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache that makes up the rest of the price."" Then he continues with his story.","By saying the distinguished men on the Nellie perform ""monkey tricks,"" Marlow is saying that primitivism also exists in the heart of civilization. When the man tells Marlow to be ""civil,"" Heart of Darkness makes the point that civilization prefers the mask of proper behavior to the truth. This self-deception is what makes civilization hollow."
"Fifty miles from Kurtz's headquarters at Inner Station, the ship comes upon a hut with a stack of firewood outside. They stop to collect the firewood, and discover a note that says ""Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously."" It is signed illegibly, but with a name too long to be ""Kurtz."" The General Manager concludes the hut must belong to the trader he wants to hang. Inside the hut, Marlow discovers a technical book on sailing that seems to have code written on it. He is astonished, and calls the book ""unmistakably real.""","The book is ""real"" to Marlow in a way that nothing else is because to produce what he takes to be the code must have taken great and concentrated effort. It must have taken work. Everything else is absurd to the point of meaninglessness: ""Hurry up. Approach cautiously."" Those commands are mutually exclusive."
"Eight miles from the Inner Station, the General Manager orders Marlow to anchor the ship in the middle of the river for the night. Marlow wants to continue on to meet Kurtz, but knows that stopping is the safer thing to do.","Marlow's desire to continue shows his obsession with finding Kurtz. Like other seekers in other quests, Marlow believes that Kurtz will have (or be) some sort of answer."
"The morning reveals a thick white blinding fog enveloping the ship. A roar of screaming natives breaks the silence, then cuts off. Frightened pilgrims hold their rifles at the ready, but can't see anything. The cannibals want to catch and eat the men on the riverbank. Marlow realizes the cannibals must be incredibly hungry, and marvels at their restraint in not turning on the white men on the ship. The General Manager authorizes Marlow to take all risks in going upstream, knowing full well that Marlow will refuse to take any. After two hours, the fog lifts and the steamship continue upstream.","The white fog surrounding and blinding the steamship while natives scream outside is a marvelous symbol. The white fog hides from view the dark jungle and black natives screaming outside, just as the ""whited sepulcher"" of civilization blinds itself from the primitive darkness at its own heart."
"A little over a mile from Inner Station, a tiny island in the middle of the river forces Marlow to choose the western or eastern fork of the river. He chooses the western, which turns out to be quite narrow. Just as Marlow spots snags ahead that could rip the bottom out of the boat, arrows shoot toward the steamship from the jungle. Marlow orders his helmsman, a tribesman from the coast, to steer straight.","The conflict between conquerors and conquered masked by the beautiful ideas motivating colonialism erupts into full view, as natives and Europeans fight to kill."
"The pilgrims open fire into the bush, putting out smoke that blocks Marlow's vision.","The ""civilized"" colonists blind themselves."
"A shotgun blasts just behind Marlow: the helmsman has dropped the wheel and started shooting out the window. Marlow jumps to take the wheel and avoid the snag ahead. The helmsman falls back from the window, a spear in his side. Blood fills the pilothouse, soaking Marlow's shoes. Marlow pulls the ship's steam whistle, which terrifies the attacking natives and drives them off. A pilgrim wearing ""pink pyjamas"" comes with a message from the General Manager and is aghast to see the dead helmsman.","Even in the battle, the absurdity of the colonial effort is always visible: here it's in the African helmsman fighting against other Africans, and neglecting his job to do it. The disaster of colonialism is also always near the surface, as in death the ridiculous helmsman suddenly becomes a tragic figure."
Marlow realizes Kurtz is probably dead and feels an intense disappointment at the thought. Marlow then tells the pilgrim to steer and flings his bloody shoes overboard.,"With Kurtz dead, Marlow's quest for truth and a civilization that isn't hollow is likely over."
"Suddenly, Marlow once again cuts short his story in order to address the men who are on the Nellie in the Thames. He tells them they couldn't hope to understand his despair at thinking he would never get to meet Kurtz, since they live in civilization with ""a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another.""","The men on the ship live in civilization, and so are blind to the meaninglessness and hollowness at its heart. The loss of Kurtz, to them, is nothing, because they have no idea what that loss entails: the possibility of meaning and wholeness."
"After a long silence, Marlow says that Kurtz wasn't dead, and launches into a series of thoughts about him. Marlow says Kurtz saw everything, including his Intended (his fiancé) as a personal possession. Marlow explains that Kurtz, in the solitude of the jungle, transformed from a man of European enlightenment to a man who presided over ""unspeakable rites"" and accepted sacrifices made in his honor. Marlow recalls a magnificent, if impractical, treatise that Kurtz wrote called On the Suppression of Savage Customs in which Kurtz argues that white men, as veritable gods next to the natives, have the responsibility to help them. Later, though, across this treatise calling for idealism and altruism, Kurtz scrawled ""Exterminate all the brutes.""","Kurtz is alive! Awesome! Right? Wrong. Had Kurtz just died, Marlow's quest would have ended, but his hope for an answer would have lived on. But Marlow makes it clear that Kurtz didn't just live, he abandoned his morals and became a monster (as shown in his scrawl across his idealistic treatise). In other words, Marlow looked to Kurtz to provide an answer, and the answer Kurtz provided is that all men have darkness in their hearts."
"Marlow returns to the dead helmsman, saying that Kurtz was a remarkable man, but wasn't worth the lives they lost in trying to find him. Marlow mourns his helmsman deeply. The man had ""done something, he had steered.""",Marlow mourns the helmsman as a fellow worker.
"Everyone on board assumes the Inner Station has been overrun and Kurtz killed. The pilgrims are happy, though, that they probably killed so many savages with their rifles. Marlow, however, is certain all the pilgrims shot too high, and killed no one.",The absurdity and incompetence of the colonial agents immediately resurfaces.
"When they arrive at Inner Station, Marlow and the other men on the ship are amazed to discover it in perfect shape. They are met onshore by a white man wearing clothes covered in colorful patches. Marlow thinks the man looks like a harlequin (a clown or jester). The man knows that the steamship has been attacked, but says, ""it's all right"" now. As the General Manager and pilgrims go to get Kurtz, the harlequin comes on board and speaks with Marlow. The man explains that he's a twenty-five year old Russian sailor who deserted and through a series of adventures working for various colonial powers ended up wandering through the Congo alone for two years.","Some critics have argued that the Russian serves little purpose in Heart of Darkness beyond telling Marlow what happened to Kurtz. However, the Russian's multicolored and patched harlequin jacket bears a striking resemblance to the map of Africa Marlow saw in the Company's headquarters. And the fact that he's worked for various colonial powers and survived years in the jungle alone also signals a kind of connection to and comfort with colonial Africa."
"When the Russian says that the hut with the stacked wood was his old house, Marlow returns the book about sailing to him. The Russian in his joy tells Marlow that the natives attacked the ship because they don't want Kurtz to leave. It's soon clear to Marlow that the Russian also has fallen under the spell of Kurtz's amazing eloquence. The Russian says about Kurtz: ""This man has enlarged my mind.""","Both the Russian and the Natives seem to adore and revere Kurtz. The question, of course, is why? It's not clear yet, but Kurtz's eloquence connects to the hollowness of civilization. Eloquence is a talent for speech, but one can speak about anything, whether noble or monstrous."
"Marlow stares at the Russian in astonishment, and thinks that the Russian ""surely wants nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in"" and that ""if the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being, it ruled this ... youth.""","Here's the Russian's secret. He's the only white man in colonial Africa not looking for money or power. Without the will to dominate, he seems safe from corruption."
"Meanwhile, the Russian begs Marlow to take Kurtz away quickly. He tells of his first meeting with Kurtz, in which Kurtz ""talked of everything"" and the Russian only listened. Since then, he says he's nursed Kurtz through two illnesses, even though Kurtz had once threatened to shoot him over some ivory.","Kurtz talked of ""everything."" Of course, talking of everything is a lot like talking of ""nothing."" Note that the color white, the color of blindness in Heart of Darkness, is the result of every color brought together into one."
"Kurtz, the Russian says, is a god to the local tribesman, who adore him. They help him as he raids the jungle and other tribes for ivory. This comes as troubling news to Marlow, who had expected that Kurtz, with his morals, would trade for ivory, not take it by force.","Here is Marlow's first solid evidence that Kurtz has abandoned his morals. (When Marlow earlier told the men on the Nellie that Kurtz became a monster, he was flashing forward in his narrative.)"
"The Russian says that Kurtz can't be judged as other men are. He adds that Kurtz ""suffered too much. He hated all this and somehow couldn't get away."" Marlow, meanwhile, lifts binoculars to his eyes and looks at the building where he thinks Kurtz is lying ill. He's startled to see that what he thought were fence posts are actually spiked human heads. Marlow tells the men on the Nellie that for all Kurtz's magnificent talent, eloquence, and learning, he was hollow at the core, and the jungle filled that hollowness.","When he described the Roman conquerors in England at the beginning of Heart of Darkness, Marlow imagined them as appalled and attracted by its savagery. The same is true for Kurtz, who both ""hated all this"" and spiked heads to stakes. His hollow civilized core, for all its outward beauty, couldn't hold out against the jungle's ""inner truth."""
"The Russian mentions that when the native chiefs came to see Kurtz they crawled up to him. This information disgusts Marlow, who comments that in contrast ""uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being something that had the right to exist—obviously—in the sunshine.""","Here's another instance of Marlow's condescending preference for the simplicity of the ""savage"" natives to the corrupt and complicated civilized men."
"The Russian can't understand Marlow's scorn at Kurtz's savage actions. He says that the Company abandoned Kurtz, who had such wonderful ideas.",The naïve Russian can't see past Kurtz's eloquence to the hollowness within.
"The pilgrims come out of the house bearing Kurtz on a stretcher. Marlow describes Kurtz as looking like ""an animated image of death carved out of ivory."" The natives swarm forward. The Russian whispers to Marlow that if Kurtz says the word, they'll all be killed. Kurtz speaks (Marlow can't hear him from so far away), and the natives melt back into the jungle.","Kurtz, the epitome of civilized man, has transformed himself into a god to the natives. He even looks like a god: ""an image of death carved out of ivory."" The lure of power and domination was too great for him too resist."
"Along the shore of the river near the ship the natives gather. Among them, next to the ship a ""savage and superb"" African woman paces back and forth. The Russian's comments about her imply that she was Kurtz's mistress.",Kurtz was so transformed by the jungle he even betrayed his Intended.
"Inside the cabin, an argument erupts between Kurtz and the General Manager. Kurtz accuses the General Manager of caring less about Kurtz himself than about the ivory Kurtz has, and also says the General Manager with his ""piddling notions"" is interfering with Kurtz's grand plans.","Somehow Kurtz still sees himself as a man of great ideas, just as civilized Europeans continue to see colonialism as noble while it abuses the Africans and steals their wealth."
"The General Manager exits from the cabin. He tells Marlow that Kurtz is very ill and that Kurtz's ""unsound methods"" ruined the district for the company. Marlow comments that Kurtz's methods couldn't be ""unsound"" because he seemed to have had ""no method at all."" Yet Marlow is more disgusted by the General Manager's fake show of sadness at Kurtz's demise than with Kurtz's atrocities, and says that Kurtz is still a remarkable man. This loses Marlow whatever favor he'd held in the General Manager's eyes.","Marlow has a choice to make between the General Manager's ""pretending"" devil of false civility, and Kurtz's ""lusty"" devil of monstrous domination. He chooses Kurtz, perhaps for the same reason he prefers donkeys and savages to Europeans. In Kurtz, though there was monstrousness, there was no lie. The jungle filled Kurtz's hollowness, but not the General Manager's."
"When Marlow is alone, the Russian approaches. He has decided to slip away, correctly sensing that he's in danger from the General Manager and his men, and seeing nothing more that he can do for Kurtz. But before departing he tells Marlow that it was Kurtz who ordered the native attack on the steamship in order to scare the General Manager away and thereby be allowed to remain at his station. The Russian gets Marlow to give him some supplies and disappears into the night.","The Russian disappears into the jungle, going off alone as no other European colonist would. That European, though, would be thinking of himself as in conflict with the jungle because, as a colonist, his goal is to dominate and subdue the jungle. But the Russian has no such dreams, and so is safe and unafraid."
"Marlow goes to sleep, but wakes suddenly just after midnight. As he looks around he notices Kurtz has disappeared. On the bank of the river, Marlow finds a trail through the grass and realizes Kurtz must be crawling. He catches up to Kurtz just before he reaches the native camp. Marlow realizes that though he's stronger than Kurtz, all Kurtz has to do is call out and the natives will attack. Kurtz, realizing the same thing, tells him to hide. Marlow says, ""You will be lost, utterly lost."" Kurtz pauses, struggling with himself. Marlow watches him, and realizes that Kurtz is perfectly sane in his mind, but his soul is mad. Kurtz's soul, Marlow says, ""knew no restraint, no faith, and no fear."" Yet in the end Kurtz allows Marlow to support him back to the ship.","This is the climax of Heart of Darkness. With the words ""You will be lost,"" Marlow forces Kurtz to battle in his own soul, to choose between his savage monstrousness and his civilized dreams of advancement and accomplishment. Kurtz ultimately chooses civilization. He chooses the impractical and idealism of his treatise ""On the Suppression of Savage Customs"" over his later brutish scrawl, ""Exterminate all the brutes."""
"The next day the ship departs. Kurtz, in the pilothouse with Marlow, watches the natives and his mistress come to the shore. Marlow spots the pilgrims getting their rifles and pulls the steam whistle. All the natives but the woman disperse. The pilgrims open fire, blocking Marlow's vision with the smoke.","The pilgrim's pointless gunfire, a product of their colonialist greed and the savage desire to hurt and dominate, puts out a smoke as blinding as the white fog. Civilization continues to blind itself."
"As they travel swiftly downstream, the General Manager is pleased. After all, soon Kurtz will be dead and the General Manager will be secure in his position without having to do a thing. Marlow is often left alone with Kurtz, who speaks in his magnificent voice and with his magnificent eloquence about his moral ideas, his hopes for fame in Europe, and his desire to ""wring the heart"" of the jungle.","Another example of false civility: the General Manager doesn't care that Kurtz is going to die as long as he can't be blamed for it. Kurtz, meanwhile, wavers between monstrous savagery and belief in the ideals of civilization that his actions have proved hollow."
"The steamship soon breaks down, which doesn't surprise Marlow. But Kurtz becomes concerned he won't live to see Europe. He gives Marlow his papers, fearful that the General Manager might try to pry into them, and one day tells Marlow that he is ""waiting for death."" Marlow is pierced by the expression on Kurtz's face ""of somber pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror—of an intense and hopeless despair."" Suddenly Kurtz cries out in a voice not much more than a breath: ""The horror! The horror!"" A short while later, the General Manager's servant appears and informs everyone: ""Mistah Kurtz—he dead.""","In Kurtz, an enlightened European surrounded by the brutal primitivism of the natives and the greed of the Company agents, Marlow saw the possibility of an answer to his own despair about the darkness of men's hearts on one side and the hollowness of civilization on the other. And Kurtz does provide an answer, of sorts: there is no answer, only despair, only horror."
"Soon after, Marlow himself falls ill. He calls his struggle with death ""the most unexciting contest you can imagine,"" and is embarrassed to discover that on his deathbed he could think of nothing to say. That's why he admires Kurtz. The man had something to say: ""The horror!"" Marlow's describes Kurtz's statement as a moral victory paid for by ""abominable terrors"" and ""abominable satisfactions.""","Marlow's esteem for Kurtz's statement is part of his general respect for work. Through the corruption of his ideals, Kurtz saw the world as it was. And like the helmsman who ""had done something, he had steered,"" Kurtz did something, he judged: the horror!"
"Marlow returns to the ""sepulchral city"" in Europe, where his aunt nurses him back to health but can't soothe his mind. The people of the city seem to him petty and silly.","The people in the city, who have never seen the jungle, can't see the hollowness of their civilization. They can't see the horror."
"A representative of the Company comes to get Kurtz's papers from Marlow, who offers him only On the Suppression of Savage Customs (with the scrawled ""exterminate all the brutes torn off"" torn off). The representative wanting more, wanting something more profitable, storms off.",The same greed visible in the Company agents is visible in the Company representative. Note how Marlow protects Kurtz's reputation.
"Kurtz's cousin soon shows up. The cousin, a musician, tells Marlow that Kurtz was himself a great musician, then leaves with some family letters Marlow gives him.",Kurtz seems to have just reflected people back at themselves. Another indication that he was more surface than self.
"Soon after, a journalist stops by. He says Kurtz wasn't a great writer, but was a great speaker. He could have been a great radical political leader—he could electrify a crowd. Marlow asks what party Kurtz would have belonged to. The journalist says any party: Kurtz could convince himself of anything. He takes On the Suppression of Savage Customs for publication.","The journalist's assertion that Kurtz could convince himself of anything further supports the idea of Kurtz's hollowness. He didn't care what his ideals were, as long as he was passionate about them."
"At last, Marlow works up the nerve to go to see Kurtz's Intended and give her the last of his letters. When she lets Marlow into her house he notices that though it's a year after Kurtz's death, she is still dressed in mourning black. She praises Kurtz as the best of all men.",Marlow's aunt established women in H of D as symbols of society's blindness to its own hollowness. Kurtz's Intended further supports this symbolism: she is completely clueless about Kurtz's true nature.
"Marlow, full of pity, does not dispute her claims. Finally, the Intended asks to hear Kurtz's last words. This is the question Marlow's been dreading. He pauses, then tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name. She cries out that she knew it and begins to weep. Marlow feels only despair, knowing he failed to give Kurtz the justice he deserved. But he just couldn't get himself to tell the Intended the truth—it would have been too dark.","Though Marlow knows Kurtz's triumph lay in his understanding of men's pretty delusions about themselves, he can't bring himself to make Kurtz's Intended see the dark reality. And Marlow knows that if he, who sees civilization's hollowness, can't bring himself to reveal the darkness beneath, then civilization's blindness is complete."
"Marlow, on the Nellie still at anchor in the Thames, goes quiet. The Narrator looks off into the distance, and says that the Thames seems to lead to the ""uttermost ends of the earth,"" seems to lead ""into the heart of an immense darkness.""","Marlow's story, though, forces the Narrator to see civilization's dark heart. The Narrator's connection of that darkness to the Thames indicates he now realizes his former romantic ideas of colonialism were symptoms of civilization's self-delusion."
"The narrator, Lieutenant Frederick Henry, an American medic volunteering in the Italian army during World War I, observes conditions where he is stationed near the front. Soldiers often march down the road carrying heavy burdens toward the fighting, while officers speed by in motor cars—any car going particularly fast is probably carrying the King of Italy, out to monitor the fighting. The start of winter brings steady rain, resulting in a cholera epidemic in which ""only"" 7,000 soldiers die.","The speeding cars imply that the roads are dangerous. Rain is associated with death throughout the novel. Henry's use of the word ""only"" to describe 7,000 dead shows his stoicism and his need to escape the horrors of war by making light of them. It also communicates just how horrible World War 1 is. If 7,000 dead can be called ""only,"" then how many total must have died?"
"Lieutenant Henry's unit moves to the town of Gorizia, which the Italian army has captured from the Austrians as part of a string of victories. The front line of the fighting is a mile away, in the mountains, and Gorizia is a peaceful place with cafés and whorehouses for the soldiers.","Even though the war is still going on nearby, the relative calm of Gorizia allows Henry and the other soldiers to forget about the fighting and enjoy the pleasures of life."
"One night in the mess hall, Henry sits with a group of fellow officers who are taunting the unit's priest for being celibate. Henry, meanwhile, is about to go on winter leave from the army. The officers think he should visit big cities like Rome and Naples, while the priest tells him to visit the quiet countryside of Abruzzi. Henry is silent during the conversation, which ends when the officers leave for the local whorehouse.","The officers think that not going to whorehouses, as they do, makes the priest less of a man. They distrust the religious conviction that allows him to remain celibate even in a stressful time of war. Henry's silence indicates that he has not yet decided which side of this argument he is on."
"Henry returns to Gorizia in the spring, after his leave is over. He greets his friend and roommate, Lieutenant Rinaldi, who wants to know all about Henry's adventures throughout Italy, including who he slept with. Rinaldi then informs Henry that a number of beautiful English nurses have arrived in Gorizia. Henry loans him fifty lire (Italian money) so that Rinaldi can impress one of them: Catherine Barkley.","The brotherly affection between Henry and Rinaldi is more important to them than any individual woman. In their world, friendship between soldiers is lasting, but women are only to be romanced and bragged about later. Love isn't even on their radar."
"At dinner, the priest is hurt that Henry did not visit the priest's family in Abruzzi. Henry, who is drunk, thinks about what it would have been like to go hunting in cold Abruzzi, and contrasts this with his memory of what it was like to go from city to city and sleep with a different woman every night.","Henry is considering two alternate ways of being a man: going off on your own to engage with nature, or enjoying women and sex."
"Henry is awoken by the ""nuisance"" of an Austrian gun battery firing in the distance. He goes to the garage where ambulances are being repaired and chats casually with a mechanic about the gun battery and about the day-to-day operations of fixing machines.","Henry reacts to enemy fire with manly understatement, calling it a ""nuisance."" At the same time, it is possible to interpret Henry's making light of the war as an effort to escape its horrors."
"That afternoon, Rinaldi invites Henry to accompany him to the British hospital to meet Catherine Barkley. Catherine is beautiful, with long blonde hair, and she and Henry begin flirting as soon as they're introduced. At one point, Henry comments on the riding crop Catherine carries. She tells him that it belonged to the man she was engaged to, who was killed in a battle in France. She asks Henry if he has ever loved anyone. He says no. On the walk home, Rinaldi comments that Catherine seems to like Henry more than him.","Catherine has experienced both love and loss, while Henry has not. Before her fiancé died, she had been innocent about what war and love really mean, as Henry is now. Yet Catherine seems to sense something in Henry that makes her trust him as someone she can confide in."
"Henry goes to pay a visit on Catherine the next day. At the hospital, he speaks with the head nurse, who asks why he, an American, joined the Italian army. He answers that he happened to be in Italy and spoke Italian. She tells him to come back in the evening if he wants to see Catherine, who is on duty.",Henry's cocky reply about joining the army suggests that he isn't yet fully aware of what it means to take on the duties of a military officer in war.
"When Henry returns that night, Catherine is in the garden with Helen Ferguson, another English nurse. After Helen departs, they talk about Catherine's nursing duties until Henry suggests they stop talking about the war. As Henry had planned, he tries to kiss her. She slaps him. He makes her laugh by saying that at least they are no longer talking about the war.","Henry and Catherine's agreement to not talk about the war is their attempt to create a world of their own, apart from the horrors of war. This is the first of many times they will try to find fulfillment in each other instead of dwelling on the war."
"Catherine eventually relents and lets Henry kiss her. Afterward, she cries on his shoulder and asks him to be good to her. He obliges by putting his arm around her, though he isn't sure what's going on. She tells him they are going to ""have a strange life.""","Henry was just out to have a fling with Catherine. But her prediction of their life together indicates that, even though they just met, she wants to treat their flirting as a serious relationship."
"Henry goes back to his room, where Rinaldi wants to know all the details of what happened between Henry and Catherine. Henry responds only by saying that he and Catherine are friends.",Henry's refusal to treat Catherine as just another conquest foreshadows the deeper feelings he will develop for her.
"It is November, and a train is pulling into St. Petersburg. In the third-class carriage, two rather similar-looking young men sit facing each other. One of them is 27 and has dark hair and a “mocking, and even malicious smile.” The other is around the same age and is wearing a hooded cloak that is certainly not warm enough for a Russian winter day. The man in the clock is blond and looks a little sickly, but his face is “pleasant.” He shivers and explains to his neighbor that he’s coming from Switzerland and had forgotten how cold it gets at home in Russia.","The opening of the novel introduces two key characters who, even from the limited information provided, are clearly opposites. Where Rogozhin is dark-haired and somewhat sinister, Myshkin has lighter features and seems kind, if a little innocent or naïve. Importantly, this passage also establishes the binary between light and dark, which will play a central role in the novel."
"The blond man happily answers the dark-haired man’s questions, explaining that he has been away for more than four years receiving treatment for “some strange nervous illness” which causes fits. He is still not cured, and he can no receive treatment because the man who had been paying for it, Pavlishchev, recently died. The blond man tried writing to his “distant relation” in St. Petersburg, Mrs. Epanchin, but didn’t get a response, and thus was forced to come back to Russia. He admits that he doesn’t know where he’s going to stay once he gets to the city, and that the small bundle he is carrying with him contains all his possessions.","This passage further confirms the sense that Myshkin is naïve, and also rather vulnerable. The combination of his epilepsy and his apparent poverty means that he must depend on the kindness of others to survive. There is certainly something naïve or overly trusting in the fact that Myshkin is coming to St. Petersburg with no money, or even a guarantee that anyone will receive him there."
"The blonde man also says he is not surprised that he didn’t receive a reply from the Epanchins, because they are so distantly related. A nearby clerk joins the conversation, someone the narrator describes as a “Mr. Know-it-all” who is always up to date on society gossip. Know-it-alls like him basically treat gossip as a profession. The blond man introduces himself to the clerk as Prince Lev Nikolaevich Myshkin, and the clerk responds that he has never even heard of this name. The prince explains he is the last in his line.","Myshkin comes from a noble family, which is why the “Mr. Know-it-all” clerk recognizes his name. Yet, at the same time, Myshkin has very little money or security. This was not a particularly uncommon occurrence in Russia at the time. Coming from a noble family, while often associated with wealth, does not guarantee that one has money."
"The dark-haired man then introduces himself as Parfyon Rogozhin, and the clerk, astonished, asked if he’s the descendant of the non-noble Rogozhin who recently died, leaving 2.5 million rubles. Rogozhin rudely replies that he is, and then furiously adds that neither his mother nor his brother told him about the money. He also explains that before he died, his father almost killed him. Rogozhin admits that his father possibly had the right to be angry with him. When his father died, the telegram containing the news was sent to his aunt, an old widow who “sits with the holy fools” all day. The aunt took the telegram to a police station because she was too scared to open it.","Again, it becomes clearer that Rogozhin and Myshkin are opposites. Whereas Myshkin is noble, poor, innocent, and naïve, Rogozhin is non-noble, rich, and seemingly mired in violence and corruption. The reader can already intuit that Rogozhin is a rather cold person, who fixates on his incoming fortune with seemingly little care about the poor relationship he has with his family."
"Rogozhin mentions Nastasya Filippovna, and the clerk exclaims that he knows her. He explains that she is a noblewoman who only associates with one man, a noble “landowner and big capitalist” called Afanasy Ivanovich Totsky, who is himself friends with General Epanchin. The clerk, who mentions that his name is Lebedev, proudly says that he “knows everything.” For a moment Rogozhin thinks that Lebedev is implying Nastasya Filippovna is engaged, and panics. However, Lebedev assures him that she remains unattached and no one knows anything about her.","As this passage shows, the social world depicted in the novel is fast-paced, and having the latest information about what is going on is very important to the characters. This is why Lebedev is proud of being a “know-it-all,” and why Rogozhin panics at the thought that Nastasya might be engaged without him knowing. Of course, it also seems clear that Rogozhin himself is interested in Nastasya."
"Rogozhin wearily explains that this is always the problem with Nastasya. She has been living with Totsky, but now Totsky is 55 and planning to marry the most beautiful woman in St. Petersburg, so wants “to get rid of her.” Rogozhin explains that he bought diamond earrings for Nastasya with money his father had given him to pay off a debt on his behalf. His father went to Nastasya and pleaded to have the earrings back, and she threw the box at him. Rogozhin promptly took a train to Pskov, where he got so drunk that he passed out and spent the night unconscious on the street.","Here, it becomes inescapably clear that Rogozhin is a passionate, corrupt, and irresponsible person with questionable morals. He is evidently in love with Nastasya, but rather than pragmatically setting himself up to marry her, he commits rash acts (such as effectively stealing money from his father to buy her gifts) and then gets blackout drunk when things don’t go to plan. This foreshadows the instability of morality and behavior that Rogozhin will go on to demonstrate throughout the novel."
"As the train pulls into the station, Rogozhin confesses that although he doesn’t know why, he “loves” Myshkin, and says he hopes that Myshkin will come and see him. He promises to buy the prince fancy clothes and “stuff your pockets with money,” at which point they’ll go to see Nastasya Filippovna together. Myshkin tells Rogozhin that he likes him too, “despite [his] gloomy face,” and that he is grateful for the offer of clothes, which he desperately needs.","Rogozhin has been won over by Myshkin, but the way he chooses to express this love and admiration is rather suspicious. He seems to only be able to connect with others through ostentatious displays of his own wealth. As a result, he tries to endear himself to Myshkin by offering to buy him things."
"General Epanchin lives in a grand house in St. Petersburg, and owns several other properties and a factory. He is known as someone “with big money, big doings, and big connections.” He is intelligent but received little education, and was the son of a “common soldier.” He has many good qualities, and despite some recent misfortune remains upbeat. He has a fondness for gambling that he doesn’t try to hide. He is 56, which is thought to be “the prime of life.” The general is healthy, with a “flourishing family.”","From this introduction of General Epanchin, it is clear that he is something of a model citizen, someone to be admired and envied. Importantly, his successful life also points to the significance of (newfound) social mobility. General Epanchin is not noble, was born into a humble family, and received little education. His rise in circumstances reflects social shifts in Russia during this time."
"Mrs. Epanchin is from the princely Myshkin family, a very old but somewhat minor line of Russian nobility. She and her husband have three daughters: Alexandra (age 25), Adelaida (age 23), and Aglaya (age 20). Although they are only noble through their mother, they are very rich and beautiful. They are all charming, intelligent, and talented; they are very close to one another and rather modest in character.","It is important to note that the Russian word that is here translated as “princely” does not actually correspond to royal status, but rather a lower rank of nobility. As the narrator shows here, the age of one’s family is important, but does not necessarily correspond directly to rank."
"When Myshkin arrives at Epanchins’ house, a servant shows him into an anteroom where he is greeted by the general’s “special attendant.” The attendant tells him to leave his bundle and wait in the reception room, but Myshkin says he would rather stay in the anteroom. The attendant objects that this is not proper, as Myshkin is a guest. This raises suspicion that Myshkin might not be who he says he is. Myshkin explains that he is related to Mrs. Epanchin, and that the two of them are the last two Myshkins. He says it is possible that the Epanchins will not receive him, as he and Mrs. Epanchin are only very distantly related, but that he expects they will.","This moment introduces the importance of social etiquette in the world of the novel. Because of his position in society (i.e. a minor nobleman and guest of the prominent Epanchin family), Myshkin is expected to behave in a certain way. Indeed, this includes the expectation that Myshkin would be haughtily dissatisfied with waiting in the anteroom. Myshkin’s violation of this expectation is so unusual and shocking that it makes the attendant question his identity."
"The valet remains disturbed that Myshkin is sharing details of his life as if they were equals; he believes that Myshkin must either be a “moocher” or a “fool.” Concluding that Myshkin must be a fool, the valet somehow likes him anyway, although he is also determined to stop talking to him because it is not proper. Yet the prince keeps talking, explaining that he is unused to how things are in Russia because he has been away for so long. The conversation is so “polite and courteous” that the valet cannot help but engage.","The valet’s mixed feelings about Myshkin establish a trend that will be repeated throughout the novel. People tend to be intrigued, fascinated, and charmed by Myshkin. Yet although they might want to stay in conversation with him, they also know that his way of being clashes with the norms and expectations of society, and thus feel conflicted or guilty."
"Myshkin explains that he has not spent much time in St. Petersburg until now. He mentions the fact that in Russia there is no capital punishment and tells the valet about witnessing an execution by guillotine. Myshkin observes that while the death itself is immediate, the leadup to it is harrowing. Yet even if they are horrified by it, people still watch. Myshkin hints that capital punishment is a violation of the Christian maxim not to kill. He observes that it is hypocritical to punish a murderer by killing him, and that he has had five nightmares about the execution since he saw it a month ago.","Capital punishment is a highly important issue in The Idiot. At the time Dostoevsky wrote the novel, capital punishment had just been abolished in Russia as part of a series of reforms by Tsar Alexander II. As Myshkin argues here, humans seem to have a natural fascination with violence, even if they also abhor it. This paradox—and the struggles it creates—becomes a significant theme in the novel."
"The valet comments that it’s good the guillotine is a swift and painless way to die, but Myshkin replies that the suffering of knowing for certain that one is about to die is far worse than the pain of a violent death. He believes it would be better to be violently killed by robbers than to be executed by the state, because at least in the former case you can retain hope to the last minute that you will be saved.","Unlike some Christians, Myshkin does not have a peaceful relationship with the idea of dying. Rather than accepting death as an inevitability or even embracing it as a chance to be closer to God in the afterlife, Myshkin feels horror when he thinks about death."
"Another man comes into the anteroom; it is Gavrila Ardalionovich (known as Ganya), an extremely handsome 28-year-old. The valet introduces Myshkin to Ganya, doing so half in a whisper so Myshkin can’t hear what he is saying. Ganya says that Mrs. Epanchin received Myshkin’s letter and that General Epanchin will be happy to see him. He objects to the fact that Myshkin has been waiting in the anteroom rather than the reception room, but before the prince can explain the general calls out, inviting him in.","The final moments of this chapter further emphasize the importance of social etiquette in the world of the novel. Like the valet, Ganya cannot believe that Myshkin would be happy to wait in the anteroom, even though there does not seem to be anything actually wrong with it. Indeed, the etiquette depicted thus far seems somewhat shallow and even pointless."
"Myshkin tells General Epanchin that he doesn’t have any specific business to discuss; rather, he has just come from Switzerland and wanted to meet. The general suspiciously responds that Myshkin must have an actual reason for being there, but Myshkin replies that he doesn’t. In response to further questions, Myshkin admits that he doesn’t know where he is staying yet, and that his little bundle contains all his possessions. General Epanchin appears to dismiss him, and the prince amiably gets up to go. However, at this point the general stops him, saying that he would actually like to get to know the prince after all.","Again, the reader sees evidence of conflicted feelings in General Epanchin’s reaction to Myshkin. On one hand the general is suspicious and can’t seem to believe that Myshkin would come to meet him without a self-interested intention. Yet is actually true that Myshkin came with such an innocent aim. When General Epanchin realizes this, his attitude shifts, and he becomes more curious about him."
"General Epanchin is surprised to learn that Myshkin is 26 and not younger, and Myshkin replies that many people say he has a “youthful face.” He says that he is worried he is annoying the general. He admits that he has no property, career, or money of his own, and that he would like to do some work, although he is limited by his illness and his lack of any skill.","In some ways Myshkin does not actually resemble a real person, and certainly not an adult. His illness has removed him from society in such a way that he takes on a mystical, fairy tale-like quality—apt for a character who is framed as a Christ figure."
"Myshkin proceeds to explain his life story to General Epanchin. Orphaned as a child, his illness meant that he had to be raised in the countryside rather than the city. The late Pavlishchev supported him, likely because he had been a friend of Myshkin’s father. Myshkin admits that “the frequent attacks of illness had made almost an idiot of him.” About five years ago Pavlishchev sent him to the Swiss clinic of Professor Schneider, who conducts research into illnesses like Myshkin’s. After Pavlishchev suddenly died, Schneider kept treating Myshkin for another two years without receiving payment. However, Myshkin eventually decided he needed to return to Russia.","Myshkin’s description of his life story illustrates the extent to which his life has never been under his own control. Of course, to some degree this is true of everyone, but because of his orphan status and his illness, Myshkin has had to be especially reliant on other people to take care of him. This is yet another way in which he can appear to be childlike to others, prompting them to underestimate him."
"General Epanchin checks that Myshkin has received some education and that he can read and write without errors; Myshkin assures him that he can. The general asks Ganya to give Myshkin a pen and paper. Ganya is holding a photo of Nastasya Filippovna, which Nastasya gave him herself when he came to see her on her 25th birthday. The general informs Ganya that Nastasya intends to give her “final word” that very night during the party at her place. Ganya goes white. General Epanchin asks about Ganya’s family; he replies that he has stopped speaking to his father, who he claims is a “fool.” His mother and sister are upset, seemingly because they don’t want him to marry Nastasya. This has something to do with her relationship to Totsky.","In contrast to the childlike Myshkin, whose life has a simple, fairy tale-like quality, Ganya appears to be overwhelmed by a complex web of problems. The issues he encounters regarding his possible engagement to Nastasya serve as a reminder that in the word of the novel, marriages are as much about abiding by familial wishes as they are about romance (in fact, perhaps much more so)."
"Prince Myshkin, meanwhile, looks at the photo of Nastasya and remarks on her beauty. Based on the photo, she has dark blond hair, dark eyes, and a thin face. He comments that even though he has only been in Russia for one day, he has already heard about her before. Ganya asks if Myshkin thinks Rogozhin is “a serious man or just a mischief maker.”  Myshkin diplomatically replies that Rogozhin has “a lot of passion […] some sort of sick passion.” General Epanchin observes that Ganya seems almost pleased to hear about Rogozhin’s attachment to Nastasya, as if this is a means of escape for himself. The general reminds Ganya that no one is forcing him to do anything. Ganya promises that he is “willing.”","The idea of passion, and in particular a dark, disturbing form of passion, is very significant in the novel. It is associated with Rogozhin perhaps more than any other character. Even though Myshkin and Rogozhin have only met once, Myshkin recognizes this trait in him immediately. Indeed, there is an important contrast between the innocent love characterized by Myshkin and the “sick passion” he describes Rogozhin as possessing."
"General Epanchin exclaims that the sentence Prince Myshkin has written on the paper he’s been given is a “model” example of calligraphy. The prince gives a long, enthusiastic response about calligraphy, revealing his expert knowledge, and the general comments that “there’s a career here.” He promises to find Myshkin a position in the chancellery, and suggests that he should stay in Ganya’s family home. He thinks it will be good for Myshkin to find his feet in St. Petersburg while staying with a respectable family, and will recommend Myshkin to them himself. He also gives Myshkin 25 roubles to start off, saying he has a long-term “intention” for their friendship that will be revealed in due time.","Myshkin’s friendly open-heartedness, while sometimes initially greeted with suspicion and even hostility, often yields kindness and generosity in return. When General Epanchin initially thought that Myshkin was here to get something out of him, he didn’t want to give it, and indeed dismissed Myshkin from his house altogether. However, now that Epanchin sees what an unselfish person Myshkin is, he is happy to provide a great many things for him."
"Ganya confirms that Myshkin would be welcome with his family. General Epanchin expresses dislike of their other lodger, Ferdyshchenko, who jokingly pretends to be related to Nastasya. The general then announces that has he has to leave immediately, but promises to tell Mrs. Epanchin about Myshkin. Once the general goes, Myshkin notices Ganya staring at the portrait of Nastasya, and observes that while Nastasya is extraordinarily beautiful, it is clear that she has suffered terribly. Myshkin comments that he can’t marry anyone because he’s sick, but that Rogozhin would probably marry Nastasya instantly if he could, and stab her “a week later.”","It is not clear whether Myshkin is physically incapable of marrying anyone due to his illness, or whether he simply believes that his condition makes him an undesirable partner. Of course, the fact that he can’t work and has no other source of income does indeed make it less likely that he will be considered a good match as a husband. In a sense, his stated inability to marry and his lack of romantic “passion” (in contrast to Rogozhin) make him a somewhat asexual figure, again similar to Christ."
"The Epanchin sisters are strong and healthy, with big appetites. Their mother, Mrs. Lizaveta Prokofyevna Epanchin, also likes to eat a lot. This morning, when General Epanchin comes to kiss his wife and daughters good morning, he notices that there is something “peculiar” about their faces. The general is a sensitive and tactful father, and has avoided rushing his daughter’s marriages. Every year the Epanchin family becomes wealthier and more respected, and thus it is advantageous that the daughters have thus far been waiting to get married.","Again, this passage emphasizes that the role of marriage has far less to do with love than it has to do with pragmatic economic and social arrangements. It also contains a useful reminder that the fortunes of an individual or family can rise and fall rather quickly. This illustrates an increase in social mobility during the novel’s contemporary time period."
"Totsky, a remarkably wealthy and high-ranking 55-year-old who is friends with General Epanchin, wants to marry the eldest Epanchin sister, Alexandra, who is 25. Aglaya is acknowledged to be the most beautiful of her sisters, and Alexandra and Adelaida have agreed to ensure that she has the best match possible, even if this means making sacrifices themselves. The marriage between Totsky and Alexandra makes perfect sense, but it is nonetheless coming about quite slowly. This is because there is a problem stopping the union from taking place.","Alexandra and Adelaida’s decision to possibly make sacrifices if it means ensuring a better match for Aglaya is not an of pure selflessness. A highly advantageous marriage for Aglaya would benefit all the Epanchins, not just Aglaya specifically. Indeed, it would raise the profile of the Epanchins and could provide them with a more luxurious, elite lifestyle."
"The problem began 18 years ago, with a very high-ranking but very impoverished nobleman named Filipp Alexandrovich Barashkov. Barashkov suffered a series of misfortunes that culminated in his estate burning down and his wife dying in the fire; he went crazy with grief and died one month later. Barashkov’s two very young daughters were placed in the care of Totsky but one soon died of whooping cough, which left only one, Nastasya. At first Nastasya was raised along with the children of Totsky’s steward, but at 12 years old Totsky realized how remarkably beautiful, charming, and intelligent she was, and he arranged for a much higher quality of education and upbringing for her.","There is a distinct similarity between Nastasya and Myshkin’s childhoods. Both were orphaned at a young age, and were forced to rely on the generosity of someone who was not a family member. At first Totsky appears to be just as altruistic and noble as Pavlishchev. However, as will soon become clear, his motivations for providing a special education for Nastasya were in fact more sinister."
"When Nastasya was 16, Totsky moved her into a wooden house in a little village called “Delight” along with a housekeeper and a maid. Totsky himself would come to visit her there, staying for months at a time. Four years later, Nastasya heard that Totsky was about to marry a society beauty, and suddenly went to St. Petersburg by herself to confront him. She told Totsky that she was going to obstruct his marriage because she wanted to spite him and to laugh at him. Totsky is the kind of man obsessed with preserving his own interests and comforts, and he was alarmed by Nastasya’s determination to destroy him.","Because of the social norms of the time, what Totsky did to Nastasya is not spelled out explicitly. However, it can be inferred that he sexually abused her from the way he deliberately isolated her and visited her for months, with no logical reason for being there. This could be framed as Totsky making Nastasya his mistress or concubine of sorts. Yet considering the inherent power imbalance between the two, given that she is only 16 and he is her guardian, it would also make sense to call it rape."
"Nastasya did not have the power to take Totsky down by legal means, or even cause too serious of a scandal. However, she was also totally reckless because she doesn’t value anything, “least of all herself.” This makes her far braver than Totsky. In recent years, she has become even more bewitchingly beautiful; there is a sort of magic in her dark eyes. Totsky eventually decided to set Nastasya up in St. Petersburg in “luxurious comfort” and to arrange an excellent marriage for her. This was five years ago. Totsky remains afraid of Nastasya, who during this time has “gained the upper hand terribly much.” She lives modestly and has few friends. Her social circle includes several minor and ridiculous people, including the “salacious buffoon” named Ferdyshchenko.","Nastasya’s relationship with Totsky provides an example of how a person with no structural power can nonetheless manage to control others around her. Part of what allows Nastasya to successfully gain a degree of control over Totsky is the fact that she is fearless—not just of Totsky, but of social norms in general. This is revealed to be true through her continued scandalous behavior and the odd mix of people with whom she surrounds herself."
"Nonetheless, Nastasya and her extraordinary beauty have become quite famous. Totsky admits that he will not know peace until Nastasya is married, and tells General Epanchin that he has found the perfect suitor: Ganya, who has apparently been passionately in love with Nastasya for years. Speaking with Nastasya and General Epanchin, Totsky offers to provide Nastasya with a dowry of 75,000 roubles. With a surprising warmth, Nastasya remarks that she is surprised Totsky is still frightened by her. She then turns to the general and tells him she has heard many great things about his daughters, that she has “a profound and sincere respect for them,” and that she is thrilled that she might help them in some way.","Again, Nastasya could be described as having no real power because she is a woman (and, worse, a woman who has likely had sex before marriage), an orphan, and someone with no money of her own. However, she acts as if she has power, including when she tells General Epanchin that she hopes she might be able to help him and his family. In a sense, by behaving as if she is powerful, Nastasya actually becomes so."
"Nastasya comments that there is much to admire about Ganya, and that she might come to love him. However, she refuses to be “rushed” in her decision. She accepts the dowry, which she maintains is not “payment for her maidenly dishonor,” but rather reparations for her misfortune. However, Totsky is deeply troubled by his belief that Nastasya knows that Ganya is actually only marrying her for money. The rumor is that Ganya hates her and plans to seek revenge against her after they marry. Meanwhile, another rumor is circulating that General Epanchin is passionately in love with Nastasya. Everyone knows that he bought her an enormously expensive pearl necklace for her birthday. Knowing his wife's suspicions on the matter, he is desperate to avoid going to Nastasya’s party, and has decided Myshkin is the perfect excuse.","The scheming, scandal, and corruption that surround Nastasya are considered improper and abhorrent within the highly restrictive, formal world of Russian high society. Indeed, Nastasya’s fearless embrace of scandal is another way in which she gains power in the world. Whereas the much more powerful men around her skitter about trying to avoid any hint of disgrace, like General Epanchin, she insists on doing things her own way, rebelling against the male-dominated hierarchy attempting to marry her off and control her fate."
"General Epanchin knows that Mrs. Epanchin will be shocked when she hears that her only living relative is basically a pauper relying on the charity of others. Yet the general also tells her that Myshkin is “a perfect child,” who is pitiful due to his illness and poverty. After some initial uncertainty, Lizaveta agrees to receive Myshkin for lunch, although she seems worried about how he will behave. The general assures her that Myshkin has wonderful manners even if he is “a bit too simple at times.” Having quickly introduced Myshkin to his family, telling them about the calligraphy he did, General Epanchin rushes off.","Although there are several ways in which Myshkin does resemble a child, the patronizing attitude with which others treat him arguably says more about them than it does about Myshkin himself. People like the Epanchins struggle to understand someone who does not conform to the expectations and norms of the elite world in which they inhabit. As a result, they dismiss Myshkin as pathetic, even as they are also generous with him."
"Mrs. Epanchin sits Myshkin opposite her and asks if he needs a napkin tied around his neck; he assures he just lays one in his lap. On Mrs. Epanchin’s request, Myshkin tells the women all about his life story. He knows the family history very well, but cannot figure out his relation to Lizaveta. She is thrilled by the conversation and encourages them all to go into the gathering room. She sits Myshkin by the fire and requests that he tell them something. The prince tells them about arriving in Switzerland and feeling terribly sad. He talks about seeing an ass and developing a fondness for the animal, and the sisters make jokes and giggle. Lizaveta apologizes, but Myshkin replies that they’ve done nothing wrong and laughs as well.","As this scene shows, at times Myshkin serves as a figure of entertainment to the other characters. They cannot understand him, but find him strange, amusing, and charming. At the same time, it is also clear that despite all the interest and attention they give him, they don’t quite take him seriously."
"They then discuss kindness, and Mrs. Epanchin admits that she sometimes her feels kindness is a flaw, because she is kind even when she feels angry. However, she also insists that she’s “not as stupid as I seem.” She asks to hear more about Switzerland, and Myshkin explains that he found the natural landscape very beautiful, but that he also always feels “uneasy” in front of nature. He says that his health improved while he was in Switzerland, and that he was happy for almost his whole time there, treasuring every day. He spent a lot of time thinking about how to live, and came to the conclusion that even in prison, one could have an “immense,” meaningful life.","There is an obvious resemblance to this conversation between Myshkin and the Epanchin women and Jesus talking to his disciples. Although on the surface Myshkin is speaking simply about his own experiences, his words contain profound moral significance. Indeed, his story reflects Christian teachings about respect for nature, finding meaning in suffering, and achieving happiness without material possessions."
"Aglaya comments that Myshkin is similar to Evlampia Nikolavna, an official’s wife who renounces material goods and lives as minimally as possible. Myshkin qualifies that life in prison can be horribly difficult, but that every life is valuable. He then tells a story of a man he met who was condemned to be executed and was even led to the scaffold before a firing squad. It took 20 minutes for the man’s sentence to be read aloud, during which time the man was absolutely convinced that he was going to die. As the man was dressed and led toward the exact position where he was to be killed, he knew he only had five minutes to live, but to him these five minutes felt eternally long and precious.","The story Myshkin tells here is something that happened to Dostoevsky himself. Sentenced to death for engagement in subversive political activities, Dostoevsky and several other men were taken to the scaffold to be shot by a firing squad. At the final moment, it was announced that their sentence had been commuted by the Tsar. Convinced he was about to die and that nothing could save him, Dostoevsky got another chance at life."
"The man, who was only 27, said goodbye to his comrades, and then was faced with two minutes in solitude, forced to contemplate his impending death. These minutes were so torturous that he eventually came to hope that the firing squad would just hurry up and kill him already. Myshkin seems to conclude his story, leaving the Epanchin women confused. He then explains that although the man survived, he did not manage to keep living as if every minute was the most precious thing in the world. It is hard to sustain such a “reckoning.” Myshkin thinks that there might be a way to live more “intelligently” than most people, and Aglaya comments that Myshkin may have found it, considering he just said he was happy throughout his time in Switzerland.","Unlike a religious parable, Myshkin’s story does not have a tidy ending. The man whose life was saved may temporarily have had a greater insight into the world, but Myshkin wisely observes that such realizations are difficult to actually remember and sustain over a longer period of time. Indeed, this is a rather universal flaw in human nature, and can be used to explain why people do not have as much moral wisdom as they perhaps ought to."
"Myshkin goes on to explain that he has personally witnessed an execution. He admits that he found it sickening, but that he also “couldn’t tear [his] eyes away.” He says that he already told the story earlier to the valet, and when Mrs. Epanchin comments that this is strange, Aglaya replies that Myshkin is a “democrat.” Myshkin is interested in the idea of portraying the face of a man who will imminently face the guillotine, reflecting that he saw a similar portrait recently in Basel. He says that when he witnessed the execution, he caught the eye of the condemned man and immediately “understood everything.” However, he can’t imagine how one would represent such an expression in a painting.","It is significant that Aglaya seems to understand Myshkin’s willingness to talk to the valet better than her parents. This suggests that there may be a generational divide when it comes to egalitarian social ideas. At the same time, Ganya was just as baffled by Myshkin’s “democratic” behavior as the older Epanchins. This indicates that Aglaya is actually unusual and perhaps rebellious in her embrace of egalitarian ideas."
"Thinking aloud, Myshkin imagines the exact details of the period leading up to an execution, including the final meal and drive to the scaffold. He imagines obsessing over how many minutes one has left to live and watching people who are allowed to keep living the rest of their lives. He imagines the man crying on the scaffold, being given the cross to kiss, and craving just a few final moments of peace. Then the sound of the guillotine, at which point the condemned man “knows everything.” Aglaya insists that Myshkin now tells them about when he was in love, but he explains that he wasn’t, just “happy in a different way.”","Again, the extent to which Myshkin is horrified by death is somewhat surprising for a Christian, as the religion focuses heavily on the afterlife. On the other hand, perhaps his long reflections on the experience of being executed are actually a form of spiritual contemplation. After all, Jesus himself was condemned to death and executed."
